/**
 * With Mapping Extensions, we need to move between two different grid systems:
 * - The normal game system, which has columns from 0-3, rows from 0-2
 * - Our custom grid, which can have any number of columns or rows.
 *
 * For example, in an 8x3 grid (2 extra columns on each side), the top-left corner would have a position of [0,2] in our custom grid,
 * but that translates to a position of [-2,2] in our natural game grid.
 *
 * This function converts from our custom grid [0,2] to a standard grid [-2,2]

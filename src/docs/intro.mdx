subtitle: Welcome to Beatmapper!

Beatmapper is a web-based *level editor* for Beat Saber‚Ñ¢. It lets you create your own "beatmaps" to be used in-game for your favourite songs.

It's still in a very early stage at the moment; most of the core functionality is in, but it's a long way from a polished product.
The editor is still usable as-is, and many have used it to create high-quality maps, but you may find some unstable or incompatible systems compared to more "modern" editors.

In the meantime, we'd recommend using an alternative beatmap editor until this one is a bit more stabilized, such as the Official Editor or [ChroMapper](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper),
especially if you're looking for a more feature-rich experience.

## Features

- üíª **Cross-platform support**. Beatmapper works on any platform with a web browser, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The editor is also distributed as a standalone PWA with offline capabilities.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Low-friction**. Beatmapper aims to let you get started in seconds. No big download, no installing anything. It even comes with a demo map to help you learn the editor.
- ‚úÖ **Focus on user experience (UX).** Beatmapper will never be as feature-rich as other editors, but my hope is that it can offer a great experience in terms of usability.
  The goal is to create an editor you enjoy using, one that doesn't frustrate you or get in your way.
  This is done through an intuitive UI, good documentation, and thoughtful quality-of-life features.

## Status

**This project is currently under maintenance**.

The software hasn't been significantly updated since late 2020.
As a result, it's currently missing a lot of things you may come to expect with a "modern" Beat Saber level editor.

The current plan to get the editor back up to speed is with a full internal rewrite of the existing codebase,
aiming for compatibility with modern beatmap features and schemas as well as some general quality-of-life improvements.

There's lots of work that still needs to be done internally, and there's no guarantees for full compatibility with certain features, such as 1-to-1 environment visualizations and "v3 lighting",
due to the differing capabiltiies and implementation details between Unity-based and web-based projects.

However, the hope is that this rewrite can serve as a nice groundwork for other contributors who would like to implement new features and workflows,
or even opening up new possibilities for community members to repurpose the editor for other potential use cases. üòâ

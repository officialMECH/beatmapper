I haven't exactly done regular releases, but I've added enough new functionality since our original public release that I think it's worth highlighting :)

This release contains mainly 2 types of things:

- Stuff for advanced users
- Quality-of-life improvements

We'll go through some of the highlights in detail!

> NOTE: Beatmapper is still in Alpha - this is v0.2, not v2.0. All the usual caveats apply!

## Mapping Extensions support

Probably the thing I'm most excited about; Beatmapper now supports Mapping Extensions.
You can now change the size of the grid, both in terms of # of rows/columns, and in terms of the height/width of each cell.

This lets you do cool stuff like create a 5-lane map, or create a 7-lane map that fits in the same space as the typical 4-lanes.
I feel like there's so much possibility here, and I'm excited to see what people do with it =)

You can enable Mapping Extensions on the Map Details pane, and then use the "Customize Grid" button in the right side panel to play with it.
[Learn more](/docs/mods#mapping-extensions) in the docs.

## Installable App

If you use Chrome, you can now "Install" Beatmapper as a regular desktop app!

After using Beatmapper for a few minutes, you should see a little "+" icon get added to the URL in the browser:

Clicking that "+" will let you install Beatmapper as a desktop app:

A desktop app comes with a couple advantages:

- Works offline (so does the webapp! But it's more intuitive to use a desktop app offline)
- No more hunting for the right tab
- Gets its own taskbar / dock icon: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6692932/68554381-0f321500-03f6-11ea-8bfc-b2c9b4cb7dc5.png)

You will always be able to continue using Beatmapper in the browser though :D

## Fast walls

You can now mark obstacles as "fast", so that they'll shoot past faster than blocks and mines.
This feature's functionality is pretty rough, but it gets the job done!
[Learn more](/docs/fast-walls).

## Color support

Beat Saber allows you to customize the colors of both sabers, both environment lights, and obstacles. Now you can set that up in Beatmapper!

## Selections in Event Mode

Using the keyboard shortcuts <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd>, you can toggle between "Add" and "Select" modes in the lighting event tab.
This allows you to quickly select notes, for bulk deleting or copy/pasting:

## Bookmarks

An often-requested feature, bookmarks make it easy to jump around in the map.

To create a bookmark, press <kbd><MetaKey /></kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> and give it a name.
Click to jump to a bookmark, right-click to remove a bookmark.

## Laser and window locks

While editing lights in Beatmapper, I kept being annoyed by the same 2 problems, so I added solutions! Turns out, they're both addressed by "locks".

### Laser locks

Often I want the left/right lasers to do things in tandem, whether it's turning them off/on or tweaking their speed.
The "Laser lock" lets you modify lasers in parallel:

### Window lock

The event view in Beatmapper shows you 16 beats at a time (by default; you can also zoom in/out to change that).
When playing a song, the window jumps to the next 16 beats when the song gets there.

When lighting the very edge of a window, it can be annoying that it keeps jumping forward!
The "window lock" loops playback within the current window.

## So much more

I've been adding lots of small quality-of-life tweaks;
I'm an [active mapper myself](https://beatsaver.com/uploader/5d152d44f8aa08000618017e), so I've been tweaking things as I go, always trying to increase user-friendliness.
